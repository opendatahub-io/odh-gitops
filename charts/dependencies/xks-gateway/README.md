XKS Gateway onboarding chart - installs the GatewayConfig CRD, gateway namespace, and GatewayConfig CR for non-OpenShift Kubernetes.

## Usage

This chart is a **subchart** of `rhai-on-xks-chart` (disabled by default in the parent chart). Configure it via `xks-gateway.gateway.*` values when installing the parent chart:

```bash
helm upgrade --install rhai-on-xks ./charts/rhai-on-xks-chart \
  --set xks-gateway.enabled=true \
  --set xks-gateway.gateway.domain=example.com \
  --set xks-gateway.gateway.oidc.issuerURL=https://keycloak.example.com/realms/rhai \
  --set xks-gateway.gateway.oidc.clientID=rhai-client \
  --set xks-gateway.gateway.oidc.clientSecretRef.name=my-oidc-secret
```

When the chart is enabled and `gateway.domain` is empty, only the GatewayConfig CRD is installed and no gateway resources are created. It can also be installed standalone for testing.

Set `gateway.domain` to the base DNS domain, such as `example.com`. The operator prefixes
`gateway.subdomain` (default `rh-ai`), producing `rh-ai.example.com` by default. Do not include
`*.` in `gateway.domain`; it would produce an invalid Gateway listener hostname. A wildcard
DNS record or TLS certificate can still cover the resulting hostname.

## CRD handling

The GatewayConfig CRD is a regular Helm template, rendered from `files/gatewayconfig-crd.yaml`
when the chart is enabled. Helm creates and updates the CRD with the release. A post-install/post-upgrade
hook waits for the CRD to become Established, then creates or updates `default-gateway` after Helm has
created the gateway namespace and chart-managed OIDC Secret.

- Disabling the dependency or uninstalling the chart removes the CRD. A pre-upgrade or pre-delete hook
  deletes `default-gateway` before the CRD is removed. The parent chart provides the pre-upgrade cleanup
  hook when the dependency is disabled, because a disabled subchart cannot render its own hook.
- Deleting a CRD also deletes all custom resources of that kind, so this chart assumes exclusive
  ownership of the GatewayConfig CRD.
- GatewayConfig schema changes merged into `rhods-operator` are automatically synchronized into this chart by the [GitOps sync workflow](https://github.com/red-hat-data-services/rhods-operator/blob/main/.github/workflows/trigger-gitops-sync.yaml).
- For local or manual updates, regenerate the CRD in the operator repository, then run `./scripts/sync-gatewayconfig-crd.sh /path/to/operator-repository` from this chart directory.

The upstream CRD currently permits wildcard `spec.domain` values. This chart rejects them because
the operator prefixes a subdomain when creating a Gateway listener on XKS.

The same lifecycle hooks are used when this chart is installed standalone or as a dependency of
`rhai-on-xks-chart`.

## OIDC client secret

**Recommended (production):** create a Kubernetes Secret in `rh-ai-gateway` and set `gateway.oidc.clientSecretRef.name` (and `key` if not `client-secret`).

**Dev/test only:** set `gateway.oidc.oidcClientSecret` (or `--set-file`) to have the chart create the Secret. The value is stored in the Helm release Secret.

## Namespace

When the gateway is configured, the chart creates `rh-ai-gateway`. The operator hardcodes this namespace; `gateway.namespace` cannot be changed.

The namespace has `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep` so `helm uninstall` does not delete workloads in `rh-ai-gateway`.
